Gravity_Game
============

This repository is exclusively for management and development of
a 'gravity game'. The name of the game has not yet been chosen.
When the name is chosen, this description will be updated. The
first stable version of the game files located on github was added
on February 15 2014, the same date this description was written.
This repository contains 4 main branching groups: master, hotfixes, development,
and releases. The master branch contains the current public working copy
of the game. A hotfixes branch is created to fix major bugs in the master
branch, and can merge with the master branch once the bug is fixed. The develop
branch is used to add new features to the game. Feature branches may merge from
this branch, but must merge back once a new feature is finished. Finally, a
release branch may be created from the development branch to package all the
changes of the development for final bug fixing and tweaking. Once the
release branch is ready for 'publishing', it can merge with the master
branch for public use.
