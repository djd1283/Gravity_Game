Gravity_Game
============

This old repository was created in 2014 to hold working code for a "Gravity Game" where a starship could move around in a gravity well created by rotating planetary objects. This was a fun side project written in Java to help understand the workings of game mechanics and similations of gravity, all in a fun gaming package. Feel free to take a look!
